# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major burden on the healthcare system because of its increasing prevalence, 
high risk of progression to end-stage renal disease, and poor morbidity and mortality prognosis. It is rapidly becoming a 
global health crisis. Unhealthy dietary habits and insufficient water consumption are significant contributors to this disease. 
Without kidneys, a person can only live for 18 days on average, requiring kidney transplantation and dialysis. It is critical
to have reliable techniques at predicting CKD in its early stages. Machine learning (ML) techniques are excellent in 
predicting CKD. The current study offers a methodology for predicting CKD status using clinical data, which incorporates 
data preprocessing, a technique for managing missing values, data aggregation, and feature extraction. A number of 
physiological variables, as well as ML techniques such as Random Forest , decision tree (DT) classification, and K-nearest 
neighbor (KNN), were used in this work to train three distinct models for reliable prediction. The LR classification method 
was found to be the most accurate in this role, with an accuracy of about 97 percent in this study. The dataset that was used 
in the creation of the technique was the CKD dataset, which was made available to the public. Compared to prior research, 
the accuracy rate of the models employed in this study is considerably greater, implying that they are more trustworthy than 
the models used in previous studies as well. A large number of model comparisons have shown their resilience, and the 
scheme may be inferred
from the studyâ€™s result
